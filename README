Quick readme on how to build:

  - Get a x86_64 gcc+binutils toolchain and add it to your path.

    64 bit x86 OS.

  - Get nasm.

  - Get the latest Dawn ZIP from http://gerigeri.uw.hu/dawn.zip
    or https://mirror.dorper.me/dawn/dawn-latest.zip
    Extract and move the Dawn directory to the root of the repo.

  - Run "make" in the root of the repository tree.

  - Enjoy.

Quick readme on how to build:

  - Get a x86_64 gcc+binutils toolchain and add it to your path.
    Your system GCC will be more than enough if you're using a
    64 bit x86 OS.

  - Get nasm.

  - Get the latest Dawn ZIP from http://users.atw.hu/gerigeri/DawnOS/download.html
    Extract and move the Dawn directory to the root of the repo.

  - Run "make run" in the root of the repository tree. (Needs qemu-system-x86_64 to run).

  - Enjoy.
